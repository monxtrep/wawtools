      NOTES:
------------------

* The CoD:WW Mod Tools require your video drivers and DirectX to be up to date (DirectX March 2008 or later).
* The CoD:WW Mod Tools have been tested and work in Windows Vista. You MUST have administrative rights and/or turn UAC off.
* The CoD:WW Mod Tools require a DirectX 9 Shader Model 3.0 compliant card and the .NET Framework Version 2.0 or higher.
* Activision does not provide support for these tools.  Please refer to the mod tools wiki at http://wiki.treyarch.com/ for support.


------------------
  INSTALLATION:
------------------

* Unzip the mod tools package to your Call of Duty: World at War directory. This is where you installed the game to. The default location is "C:\Program Files\Activision\Call of Duty - World at War". Make sure you select "Yes to All" when prompted about copying over files.

* Once unzipped you will want to make a shortcut to: [gamepath]\bin\Launcher.exe
  - Launcher is the equivalent to the CoD4CompileTools and ModBuilder from the CoD4 Mod Tools.

RUNNING THE TOOLS:
------------------

When running launcher for the first time, the very first thing you should do is press the "Converter" button to convert assets.

When running CoDWaWRadiant for the first time, you will be prompted to load a project file. You will need to load the included codwaw.prj project file which is located in "\bin".

When running EffectsEd3 for the first time, you will be asked to provide the location where the game is installed. The default location is "C:\Program Files\Activision\Call of Duty - World at War".
